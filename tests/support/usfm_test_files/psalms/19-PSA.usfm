\q
\v 1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked,
\q Nor standeth in the way of sinners, 
\q Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers: 
\q
\v 2 But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; 
\q And on his law doth he meditate day and night. 
\q
\v 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water,
\q That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, 
\q Whose leaf also doth not wither; 
\q And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 
\q
\v 4 The wicked are not so, 
\q But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 
\q
\v 5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, 
\q Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
\q
\v 6 For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; 
\q But the way of the wicked shall perish.
