\v 4 What follows is how God created the heavens and the earth.
\p God, whose name is Yahweh, made the heavens and the earth.

\p
\v 5 At first there were no plants growing, because Yahweh God had not yet caused rain to fall on the ground. Furthermore, there was no one to plow the ground for planting crops.
\v 6 Then God said, "I command that there be an empty space like a huge dome to separate the water into two parts." 
\v 7 And that is what happened. God made the empty space like a huge dome and it separated the water that is above it from the water on the earth that is below it.
\v 8 God named the space like a huge dome "sky." This was an evening and morning, the second day.
